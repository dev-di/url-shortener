URL-SHORTENER CHALLENGE
	Java project written by Diana Ekstr√∂m in May 2018. This document provides installation- and running instructions.

Introduction
	A url-shortener service is a service that redirects a short url to a longer, url.
	This project is part of a coding challenge.
	In this instructions we will install and run the service on our local host.

Main technologies used in this project
	Java, Spring Boot, jUnit4, Maven

How to install
	Import as a Maven project in your java IDE from 
	git@github.com:dev-di/url-shortener.git

How to start the service
	The service could be started by pressing run in your IDE, or from the 
	command line by executing the command mvn spring-boot:run 
	from the project directory. The service is then run from your web browser.

Example
	Assuming the application is running for the first time on localhost port 8080. 

	Request: localhost:8080/service/shorten?url=youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
	Answer:  localhost:8080/1

	This request will put the url youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ in the service url dictionary and map it to the new url localhost:8080/1

	If you then put localhost:8080/1 in your browser, you will be automatically redirected to youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

	To check how many times localhost:8080/1 have been used: 
  
	Request: localhost:8080/service/count?url=localhost:8080/1
	The answer will be the number of redirects from localhost:8080/1 to youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ the service has performed

More documentation
	There are more examples of the behaviour of the service in the jUnit test

Suggestion of some future improvements of the service
	* Save data on the disc (As for now, the service will forget all mappings and 
	countings when it restarts)
	* Do not only use base-10- digits in the path (if letters are also used, the path will 
	be of shorter length)
	* Allow customised path names
